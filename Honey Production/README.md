# üêù Honey Production
## Use of Simple Linear Regression machine learning model to predict honey production for future years
- We have our dataset of honey production by different states for the last ~20 years.

- Using pandas and numpy to find the mean production of each year, the data is re-arranged to total honey production and years as our X and Y data. 
- This data is displayed using a scatter chart

- Using SKlearn's linear regression function, we can find the line the best fit for our scatter:

- Now that we have our line, we can extend to predict what honey production might be in 2042:
