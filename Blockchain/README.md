# ðŸ”— Blockchain Implementation
## Use of Object-Oriented Programming to construct a blockchain with proof-of-work
- First, using OOP to create a block, which will contain a timestamp, transaction, previous hash and current hash
- Then, using OOP to create the blockchain which contains functions to create a genesis block, add blocks, validate the chain based on hashes.
- The blockchain will also contain a proof-of-work which takes the form of a guessing game that involves the use of hashing based on nonce values:

- Now we create 3 test transactions that should each represent a block in the chain
- When run, we can see the 3 blocks along with the genesis block, each with their timestamp, transactions, current hash and previous hash

- If we add a fake transaction as the 2nd transaction, the blockchain will notice the hash difference and send an alert:
