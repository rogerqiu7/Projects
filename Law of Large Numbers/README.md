# ðŸ”¢ Law of Large Numbers 
## Use of hypothesis testing functions to build visualizations in proving the Law of Large numbers
- Used function to create 2 coins that randomly flip heads or tails
- Counted the probability of two heads at the same time and measured it with the true probability of 0.25.
- As Number of flips increased, experimental probability becomes closer to true probability.
