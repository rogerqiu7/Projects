# Handwriting recognition â€“ Use of SKlearn clustering and KMeans machine learning model to predict numbers by reading handwriting

# 10 different digits here (0 to 9) means there should be 10 different clusters, so k (num_clusters) is 10

  # Initialize subplots in a grid of 2X5, at i+1th position

  # Display each image of the model at i location, reshaped and using a colormap setup
  ax.imshow(model.cluster_centers_[i].reshape((8, 8)), cmap=plt.cm.binary)
