# ♾️ Differential Calculus Limits
## Proof of limits theory by using functions to visualize convergence of derivatives 
- Used a function and matplotlib to create and visualize a basic exponential and sine derivative function
- The derivative here appears to be approaching 1 as h gets smaller

- The derivative here appears to be approaching .54 as h gets smaller

- Using numpy and matplotlib, we plot how the functions would look as h gets incrementally smaller
- We can see the convergence of the functions as h approaches 0, x gets infintely closer to 1

- Here, with the sine function, as h approaches 0, x gets infintely closer to 0.54
